                The National Taxpayers Union estimates 60% of all United States properties are over assessed while fewer than 5% of homeowners appeal their assessments because they do not know they can. Philly Tax Appeals makes sure that our clients understand assessments and have an opportunity to take advantage of substantial savings.
